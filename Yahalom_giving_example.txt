## Prompt:
The following are the descriptions of the Yahalom protocol, the Needham-Schroeder symmetric-key authentication protocol written in natural language, and the script for the Needham-Schroeder symmetric-key authentication protocol for Tamarin Prover . Write a script for the Tamarin Prover for the Yahalom protocol, using the Needham-Schroeder symmetric-key authentication protocol as an example of generating script from the natural language description.''

【Yahalom protocol in natural language】
Yahalom is an authentication and secure key-sharing protocol designed for use on an insecure network such as the Internet. Yahalom uses a trusted arbitrator to distribute a shared key between two people. This protocol can be considered as an improved version of Wide Mouth Frog protocol (with additional protection against man-in-the-middle attack), but less secure than the Needham–Schroeder protocol.

Protocol description
If Alice (A) initiates the communication to Bob (B) with S is a server trusted by both parties, the protocol can be specified as follows using security protocol notation:

* A and B are identities of Alice and Bob respectively
* Kas is a symmetric key known only to A and S
* Kbs is a symmetric key known only to B and S
* Na and Nb are are nonces generated by A and B respectively
* Kab is a symmetric, generated key, which will be the session key of the session between A and B

A->B: A, Na
    Alice sends a message to Bob requesting communication.
B->S: {A, Na, Nb}Kbs
    Bob sends a message to the Server encrypted under Kbs
S->A: {B, Kab, Na, Nb}Kas, {A, Kab}Kbs
    The Server sends to Alice a message containing the generated session key Kab and a message to be forwarded to Bob.
A->B: {A, Kab}Kbs, {Nb}Kab
    Alice forwards the message to Bob and verifies Na has not changed. Bob will verify Nb has not changed when he receives the message.

【Needham Schroeder protocol in natural language】
The Needham–Schroeder protocol is one of the two key transport protocols intended for use over an insecure network, both proposed by Roger Needham and Michael Schroeder.[1] These are:

The Needham–Schroeder Symmetric Key Protocol, based on a symmetric encryption algorithm. It forms the basis for the Kerberos protocol. This protocol aims to establish a session key between two parties on a network, typically to protect further communication.

Here, Alice (A) initiates the communication to Bob ⁠B. S is a server trusted by both parties. In the communication:
* A and B are identities of Alice and Bob respectively
* Kas is a symmetric key known only to A and S
* Kbs is a symmetric key known only to B and S
* Na and Nb are nonces generated by A and B respectively
* Kab is a symmetric, generated key, which will be the session key of the session between A and B

The protocol can be specified as follows in security protocol notation:
A->S: A, B, Na
    Alice sends a message to the server identifying herself and Bob, telling the server she wants to communicate with Bob.
S->A: {Na, Kab, B, {Kab, A}Kbs}Kas
    The server generates Kab and sends back to Alice a copy encrypted under Kbs for Alice to forward to Bob and also a copy for Alice. Since Alice may be requesting keys for several different people, the nonce assures Alice that the message is fresh and that the server is replying to that particular message and the inclusion of Bob's name tells Alice who she is to share this key with.
A->B: {Kab, A}Kbs
    Alice forwards the key to Bob who can decrypt it with the key he shares with the server, thus authenticating the data.
B->A: {Nb}Kab
    Bob sends Alice a nonce encrypted under Kab to show that he has the key.
A->B: {Nb-1}Kab
    Alice performs a simple operation on the nonce, re-encrypts it and sends it back verifying that she is still alive and that she holds the key.

  Description from SPORE:
  (http://www.lsv.fr/Software/spore/nssk.html)

  Needham Schroeder Symmetric Key

  A, B, S :           principal
  Na, Nb :             nonce
  Kas, Kbs, Kab :     key
  dec :               nonce -> nonce

  1.    A  ->  S  :    A, B, Na
  2.    S  ->  A  :    {Na, B, Kab, {Kab, A}Kbs}Kas
  3.    A  ->  B  :    {Kab,A}Kbs
  4.    B  ->  A  :    {Nb}Kab
  5.    A  ->  B  :    {dec(Nb)}Kab

  This protocol establishes the fresh shared symmetric key Kab.

  Messages 1-3 perform the distribution of the fresh shared symmetric key Kab
  and messages 4-5 are for mutual authentification of A and B.

  The operator dec is decrementation.

  The protocol must guaranty the secrecy of Kab: in every session,
  the value of Kab must be known only by the participants playing the roles of A, B and S in that session.

  If the participant playing B accepts the last message 5,
  then Kab has been sent in message 3. by A (whose identity is included in the cipher of message 3).

  Authentication attack by Denning and Sacco.
  Assume that I has recorded the session i and that Kab is compromised.
  After the session ii, B is convinced that he shares the secret key Kab only with A.
  i.1.    A  ->  S    :      A, B, Na
  i.2.    S  ->  A    :      {Na, B, Kab, {Kab, A}Kbs }Kas
  i.3.    A  ->  I(B)  :      {Kab,A}Kbs
                 assume that Kab is compromised
  ii.3.    I(A)  ->  B  :    {Kab,A}Kbs
  ii.4.    B  ->  I(A)  :    {Nb}Kab
  ii.5.    I(A)  ->  B  :    {dec(Nb)}Kab

  We use tags and only one server.

Explanation of the Protocol Script:Init and Reveal Rules: These rules generate and reveal long-term keys, setting up the initial shared keys for participants and the server.A_to_B: Alice (A) sends her identity and nonce (Na) to Bob (B).B_to_S: Bob encrypts Alice's identity, nonce Na, and his own nonce Nb under his long-term key Kbs and sends it to the server.S_to_A: The server generates a session key Kab, then sends back two encrypted messages:One for Alice, including B, Kab, Na, and Nb encrypted under Kas.Another for Bob, containing A and Kab encrypted under Kbs.A_to_B_final: Alice forwards the server's message to Bob and sends Nb encrypted under Kab, ensuring freshness.B_Verify: Bob verifies that Nb matches, confirming the integrity of the key exchange.This script should provide the structure needed for Tamarin Prover to simulate the Yahalom protocol based on the descriptions and the Needham-Schroeder example.

## Prompt:
In a rule where a long term key is used, please insert a premise with LongtermKey predicate declaring the owner of the key.

## Response:
Certainly! I've updated the script to include a LongtermKey predicate in the premises of rules where a long-term key is used to declare the owner of the key.

Explanation of Changes:S_to_A Rule: Combined msg1 and msg2 into a tuple <msg1, msg2> and included it in a single Out predicate.A_to_B_final Rule: Similarly, combined msg1 and msg2 into a tuple <msg1, msg2> and included it in a single Out predicate.This approach ensures that when multiple messages are sent, they are combined into a single Out predicate as specified.

## Prompt:
Show the pairs of rules such that each pair represents consecutive sending of messages from a participant.

## Response:
Here are the pairs of rules in the Yahalom protocol script that represent consecutive sendings of messages from the same participant:Participant A (Alice):Pair 1: A_to_B → A_to_B_finalExplanation: The rule A_to_B represents Alice's initial message to Bob, and A_to_B_final represents her final message to Bob. These two rules are consecutive messages sent by Alice to Bob within the protocol sequence.Participant S (Server):Pair 2: S_to_AExplanation: This rule involves the server sending two messages in one step. Since this is a single rule with two messages sent in a tuple (combined in a single Out predicate), there is no further pair for consecutive messages from the server.Participant B (Bob):Pair 3: B_to_S → B_VerifyExplanation: The rule B_to_S represents Bob's message to the server, while B_Verify represents Bob's verification of the nonce Nb. These are consecutive steps, but they are not consecutive sendings to the same participant, as B_Verify is a reception rather than a sending action.In summary, the main consecutive pair of rules with actual consecutive sendings of messages are:Alice: A_to_B → A_to_B_finalServer: A single rule S_to_A sends two messages

## Prompt:
Ensure that if the first rule of such a pair contains a predicate with its name beginning with "State", then the premise of the second rule in the pair contains the same predicate and no other "State" predicate. Remove "State" predicate from the premise of a rule if the rule has no subsequent sending rule from the same participant.

## Response:
Here is the updated script with adjustments to the State predicates to ensure that:In each pair of consecutive message-sending rules, if the first rule contains a State predicate in its conclusion, then the second rule includes that same State predicate in its premise, and no other State predicate.State predicates are removed from the premises of rules where there is no subsequent sending rule from the same participant.

Explanation of Changes:A_to_B → A_to_B_final:A_to_B concludes with StateA1($A, $B, ~na), which is included as the only State predicate in the premise of A_to_B_final.B_to_S:Since Bob has no subsequent sending rule, the StateB1 predicate remains only in the conclusion of B_to_S without being included in the premise of any other rule.S_to_A:The server sends two messages in one rule, so the StateS1 predicate remains in the conclusion without any premise dependency for consecutive sending.B_Verify:This is the final rule, and no State predicate is required in its premise.This structure aligns with your preferences for handling consecutive sendings and managing State predicates in the Tamarin Prover script.
